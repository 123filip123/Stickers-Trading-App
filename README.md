All collectors of sticker albums, regardless of album theme, face the same problem. Albums can contain anywhere from 200 to nearly 1,000 stickers. Tracking the state of the stickers, most importantly which stickers are missing, and which and how many duplicates they have, is usually done by writing it down on a piece of paper. Each time a missing sticker is obtained, or a duplicate is obtained or exchanged, this sheet is supplemented and crossed out. The process itself takes a lot of time. Eventually the sheet becomes unreadable and useless.

Exactly this problem is solved in this thesis. The mobile app offers sticker collectors a simple and intuitive interface to manage the state of their sticker albums. Through the implementation we can see how several large and modern technologies can be used together to create such a system. The application is available on Android and iOS devices.

Used technologies:
 - React Native
 - Node.js
 - Mongo Atlas
